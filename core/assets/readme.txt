How to:

#Add vocabulary cards
To add vocabulary cards to the program, 
put the question as an imagefile in the 
"questions"-folder and the 
matching answer in the "answers"-folder,
both files should get the same name.
You find these folders in the 
"assets" folder in the directory of
the program.
Use .jpg and .png only.
The images should not exceed a 
resolution around 1000 x 400 pixels. 
Otherwise the pictures will overlap.
This program is a work in progress.

#Use the program
Click the lens to see the solution.
If you knew the answer, click the 
"right button", if not the "wrong button".
Every correctly answered question will be
removed from the question pool until
you solved all of them or 
you restart the program.
Sessions will not be saved yet, 
the program resets on startup!

Have fun
